    The first project students have started working is based on Artificial Intelligence which would  be inaugurated soon.Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines that can simulate human cognition and behavior.
   <br>  AI systems can perform tasks such as language translation,  <br>image recognition, and autonomous vehicle navigation,
      and they can be classified into two categories: narrow AI and general AI. 
      Narrow AI systems are designed to perform specific tasks, while general AI systems are designed to be able to perform a wide range of tasks.
